# SOEN-6611-METRICSTICS
# Introduction

Descriptive statistics play a crucial role in quantitatively summarizing data, providing valuable insights into data sets’ central tendencies, variability, and frequency distributions. METRICSTICS, a portmanteau of "METRICS" and "STATISTICS," represents a system designed for the computation of key descriptive statistics, including minimum (m), maximum (M), arithmetic mean (μ), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and standard deviation (σ). This system is intended to take a random number of data values as input and generate their respective descriptive statistics. These data may be real-world, obtained from authoritative sources, or artificially generated using random data generators.

The current scope of the project is limited to:
1. An input of random values from finite data set (N1, N2, N3,...NM)
2. An output of any one of the following:
  A.	Descriptive Statistics: METRICSTICS generates statistics like minimum, maximum, mean, mean absolute deviation, and standard deviation.
  B.	Error Handling: The system provides clear error messages when issues arise during data processing.
